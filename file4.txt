The warmth on my skin, The heat on my face, Humidity in the air, 
The sweat after a race. Longer days with fun and joy, 
Is what summer brings. The sky in a brilliant shade of blue, 
And so many more things. The cold, tingling feeling of the pool, 
As our skin gives a sigh of relief. Our minds thinking of the lazy days, 
When nobody is in grief. The sun shines merrily above the horizon, 
Sharing its heat and light. 
A smile on everybodyâ€™s face,
